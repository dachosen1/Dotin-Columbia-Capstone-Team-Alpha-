Final Capstone Project for Columbia University 


### **Problem Statement**
**30% of users falsely fill out psychometric surveys**

How can we validate these user survey responses?

### Research Questions 
1. **Mouse Activity:** How do we use user mouse activity to validate survey answers to psychometric questions? 
2. **Response Time:** Does the variability in survey response time indicate suspicious behavior?
3. **Survey Question:** Does the level of suspicious behavior vary across different types of survey questions?


### Approach 
Apply unsupervised & supervised learning techniques to identify users who exhibit suspicious behavior in survey completion
